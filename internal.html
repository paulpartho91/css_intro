Subject: Application for Leave During Holidays

Respected Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to request your kind approval for leave from school during the upcoming holidays. Due to [mention the reason, such as a family trip, personal commitments, etc.], I will be unable to attend school from [start date] to [end date].

I assure you that I will make every effort to minimize disruption to my studies during this period. I will diligently complete any pending assignments or projects before my leave begins and will catch up on any missed lessons promptly upon my return.

I kindly request your approval for this leave and would be grateful for any guidance or instructions regarding any academic responsibilities I may have during this time.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your favorable response.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
